I used to have a ######,
One day I rode too fast.
#### I spilled my coffee,
He called me an ass.

I used to have a money,
As naughty as could be.
One day #### I woke up,
My monkey, he spanked me!

#####!
(Oh YES!)
On no!
La La La...

Drinking at the Hofbrau,
My waiter was a lout
I said I wanted schnitzel,
Not some sour Kraut.

#####!
(Oh mein schnizel!)
(Nein! Nein! 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, Nein!)
#####!

Had a monkey robot soldier
Living inside my head.
So I took some wormwood.
Tried to kill him dead!

#####!

La la la...

I triedsta go whale spotting
On my new Ski Do,
But then I ran aground.
Ski Don't for me and you!

#####!
(Look out for the whales!)
#####!
La la la...

To get the freshest sausages
I had to get there first,
But #### I got them all home,
Them brats, they were the worst!

#####!
#####.
La la la...

I used to have a ######,
One day I rode too fast
#### I spilled my coffee,
He called me an ass.

La la la...
######!
